# Banano + Minecraft = Bananocraft

Yes, ser... now you can

![Banano](/banano.png)
- Bridge the meatspace economy with the Minecraft Metaverse economy (check out [an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR-cTu4XxLY))
- Play a classic game enchanced by an added in-game cryptocurrency that is fast, feeless, and B.E.N.I.S. (If you have not been "yellow-pilled" yet, just click [here](https://banano.cc/yellowpaper/), fren)

# The Banano Economy Minecraft Plugin
- Bananocraft runs on a plugin that was created by a well known Banano community member, Kirby, and it is open source with Java code available [here](https://github.com/Kirby1997/BananoCraft)
- Anybody can run their own server with Banano as an economy with this plugin :)
  - That means you can, and, you should, make a Bananocraft server, too!

# Can't Wait to Get Started?
