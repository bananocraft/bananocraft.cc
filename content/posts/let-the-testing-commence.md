Calling all monkeys! Bring groups of friends/frenemies/randos onto the servers!

It is now time to test the preliminary deploys of bebe, and benis, two new Bananocraft servers.

The more the merrier, since you can only tip while others are there.

- Invite others
- Take screenshots and send them to me
- Have fun

And use the following command cheatsheet:
- /deposit
  - gives you a link with a QR code to deposit BAN
- /bal
  - shows your balance
- /tip <amount> <player>
  - e.g. /tip 1919 mconstant
  - tips an amount of BAN to a particular player
- /withdraw <banano_address>
  - e.g. /withdraw ban_1dd7w8z7cx57e4u4h45rcr399zgpnfcsqi61ifbxcowoauox1i9sqosyd6wu
  - withdraws your in-game funds to a particular wallet

Good luck, brave souls!
